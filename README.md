## Welcome to Riffing on the Famous Series Published by J.C.Wiley & Sons

Welcome to DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) for First Timers!
Of course, beginners, newbies, DAW virgins, *absolute* beginners, *"d-star-mmies"*,
and *"d-word-ies"* are also welcome here - but don't ever fucking say *"d*mmies"*!!
Because I am *not* one of *those*, and would never call *you* that, *ever!*

## What's in This Repo

Brainstorming docs, plans, outlines, maybe some dialog, and ultimately some
videos about how to use Digital Audio Workstations, intended for first-timers,
absolute and total beginners, but definitely not for "d-word-ies".

## About this repo's name

My original idea was to call this project "daws_for_d-star-mmies", as a play on
"DAWs for D*mmies", but *J. C. Wiley & Sons* has trademarked the idiom "XXX for Dummies"
titles for books, so it would probably apply to videos as well.

Oops!

So we are going with **"DAWs for First Timers".**
