Big picture guidelines for consistency.

## Important: Specific Guidelines

- Keep videos focused and on point
  - Sort diversions (e.g., name my hosts after Film Noir Actresses) are ok
  - Quickly return to the central topic (or just edit out the bs!)
- Videos must be **consistent, informing, and entertaining.**
- Explain any jargon words
  - Tell people to leave a comment if they don't understand something


## Fun Idea?

- Do two versions of each episode:
  - One Explicit/Salty
  - One Clean
  - This riffs on my self-censorship with regards to the whole *"D\*mmies"* thing
