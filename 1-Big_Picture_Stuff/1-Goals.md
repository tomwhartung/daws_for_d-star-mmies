Stick to these goals, without overthinking things, talking about my opinions or
age or experience or getting off track and trying to be cute or surrealistic or whatever, etc.

## Goals

- 1. Get some experience creating videos and posting them to youtube
  -  I do *not* want to perform live so this is *extremely important*
- 1. Provide first-timers, aka "d-word-ies", with the basics they can't find elsewhere
  -  Techie tips
  -  Get sound out of their KB Controller
  -  Record midi and voice
  -  Try to make the videos interesting and *fun*
- 1. Get familiar with these basics so that they become second nature
  -  We may find we want to cover some additonal topics: quantization, robot voice, etc.
- 1. Maybe, *maybe* try to make some money off affiliate marketing
  -  This would be nice but it is *not* the main goal, which is to *get some experience*
