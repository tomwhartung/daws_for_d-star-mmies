## Big Picture

I want to do a series, rather like a TV series.  The pilot must set the tone, etc:

-  See the *Great Courses **Screenwriting 101** Course*

Also they must be **consistent, informing, and entertaining.**

## Specific Guidelines

- Keep videos short: 3-5 mins

- Explain any jargon words
  - Tell people to leave a comment if they don't understand something

- Do two versions of each episode:
  - One Explicit/Salty
  - One Clean
  - This plays into my self-censorship with regards to the term *"D\*mmies"* 

- End with something fun
  - Learning the techie stuff just sort of takes all the passion out
  - Offer encouragement, try to get the blood flowing again
  - Other videos are so *dry*, because the topic is *dry*
  - Perhaps bit of art history or critique of current events
    - **Try to be humourous, make it entertaining, like Lewis Black**
    - Perhaps a fun quote, historical anectdote, review, etc.
  - Considering doing this while wearing my:
    - *Daft Punky Grateful Dead Ramblin Rant Helmet*
  - Maybe call it my:
    - *"Daft Punky Grateful Dead Ramblin Rant Segment"*
  - Maybe end it with a *"Homework Assignment"*
    - *"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to"*
    - For example, in the first episode assign watching the movie
[*Daft Punk Unchained*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3833822) as "Homework"
