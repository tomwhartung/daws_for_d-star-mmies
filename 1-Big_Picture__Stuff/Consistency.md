- Keep videos short: 3-5 mins
- Considering doing two versions of each episode:
  - One Explicit/Salty
  - One Clean
- End with something fun
  - Learning the techie stuff just sort of takes all the passion out
  - Offer encouragement, try to get the blood flowing again
  - Other videos are so *dry*, because the topic is *dry*
  - Perhaps bit of art history or critique of current events
    - **Try to be humourous, make it entertaining, like Lewis Black**
    - Perhaps a fun quote, historical anectdote, review, etc.
  - Considering doing this while wearing my:
    - *Daft Punky Grateful Dead Motorcyle Rant Helmet*
  - Maybe call it my:
    - *"Daft Punky Grateful Dead Rant Helmet Segment"*
  - Maybe end it with a *"Homework Assignment"*
    - For example, in the first episode assign watching the movie
[*Daft Punk Unchained*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3833822) as "Homework"
