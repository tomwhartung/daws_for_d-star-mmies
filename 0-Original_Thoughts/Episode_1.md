The pilot is the most important episode.

It is where we establish the main characters - and the conflict between them - that drives the entire series.

## Opening Dialog - Introducing Your Humble Narrator

Paying tribute to the R. Stones and Star Wars here, I am.

"Please allow me to introduce myself!

"Long ago, in a city far, far away, I used to play music.

"I played trumpet in high school in the '60s and early '70s, then played bass in the '70s and '80s.

"I actually [gasp!] managed to make some money playing bass in a Bluegrass band in the 1980s!

"But I got tired of playing Rocky Top for a bunch of drunks, and found I could make a lot more than the occasional $25 per night programming computers (in [cough] Cobol [cough])

"And then I went back to school and finished my BS in Math and took an Art History of American Photography class - just for fun.

"This class changed my life, because I learned that a lot of Fine Art Photographers were saying the same thing in photography as all my hippie classic Rock music groups that I loved so much were saying!

"So in 1986 I quit my job, quit playing music, and went to Grad School."

**Now, where's the conflict??**  Need to fix that.  Just brainstorming right now.
