The first episode needs to establish the conflict, and the last episode needs to resolve it,
at least temporarily.

## Initial Episode List

### Episode 1: Introducing Our Cast of Characters

- Welcome to DAWs for Newbies!
- Allow me to introduce myself and others, and share some details about our Cast of Characters: the hardware I am using
- Me/m√≠/moi
  - A bit embarassed to admit it took me quite a while to get a sound out of Larry the Launchkey
    - That is the main thing driving these videos
    - All the ones I found were *not* targeted for newbies/first-timers/d-word-ies
  - I have a BS in Math and an Masters Degree, and am now a retired programmer
  - Played Trumpet in High School in the late '60s-early '70s
  - Played Bass in a Bluegrass band in the early 1980s
  - I have a lot of Openness, but will try to stay focused
  - I am not a *"d-word-ie"* but sure felt like one there for a while!
- Lawrence the Launchkey, by Novation
  - At first I wanted something smaller
  - Get all my music supplies at Guitar Center
    - I wanted the Mini, but they guy brought out the normal-sized KB
    - It cost more than I wanted to spend but he assured me it was the one I wanted
    - He was right: I have learned the Mini ones are too small, even if you have smallish hands
  - Lawrence, or "Larry" as I like to call him when things are going well, is silent atm
    - We will fix that in the next episode with a variety of DAWs
  - I am happy with my purchase!
- Mary (Astor) the Mac
  - Very cute but only 256G disk space
  - Used mostly just for web surfing, so I thought it's be ok
  - Larry came with a bunch of free software
  - I installed most of it, but ran out of disk when installing Komplete Kontrol
- Dorothy (Malone) the Brand New Win 11 laptop (refurbished)
  - Not as cute as mary but much more functional for about half the price
  - Dedicated (mostly) to music
  - Got a big screen and a whole 1T of disk
    - Using mary I learned it really helps to have two screens going
      - 1 for the DAW
      - 1 for the Reference Manual
  - Was able to re-install most of the software that I'd already installed on mary
    - Was *not* able to re-install Komplete Kontrol because they allow only one download
      - Did I mention that I did not see any sort of warning that the download would be that big until I started it?
    - **BUMMER**
- Martha (Vickers) the Linux Box
  - When the disk on mary filled up, I turned to a Win 10 box I had, martha
  - The old OS wouldn't update, plus she has just 500G disk and is a desktop with just one screen
    - So I bought Dorothy, whom you just met
  - I am not a huge fan of Windows - one is plenty!
  - So I replaced the Win 10 with Ubuntu 24.04
- I get all my techie stuff from Microcenter
- You
  - Please leave a comment if I use a jargony word or somehow make you feel like a *"D-word-ie"*
  - If I get some positive feedback on these first videos, I will do some more!
- Closing
  - I'd like to close with a little song or something, but without a DAW, Larry is silent!
  - Hope to see you in Episode 2, where we will fix that, using multiple DAWs on multiple PCs!
