These are the elements that Angus Fletcher addresses in his Screenwriting 101
Great Courses lectures.

Let's address these elements here, for grins sure, but also to try to help me
produce an interesting product.

## Story World

The world contains Instruments, Computers, DAWs, and Sounds.

## Scene

Scenes will include:

- Me talking and:
  - Sometimes pointing to a white board
  - Sometimes pointing to the Launchkey or a computer
- DAWs on Computer screens
  - Waveform - on martha or dorothy or mary
  - Ableton - on dorothy or mary
  - Cubase - on mary or dorothy

## Characters

These are the main characters in my *Tom Versus Technology* drama:

- Me, your narrator and main protagonist
- Lawrence ("Larry") the Launchkey and my New Nemesis
- Mary the Mac
- Martha the Linux box
- Dorothy the Win 11 box
- Possible minor "characters":
  - Harry the Helmet
  - There may be occasional guests

## Plots

Plots involve:

- 1. Starting with a problem - a desire to create something or perform some other task
  - This is the *conflict:* human versus machine
- 1. Figuring out how to solve the problem
- 1. Demonstrating how cool/beautiful the solution sounds

## Tone

- Initially, some frustration
- At the end, either victory or more frustration, depending on the episode
